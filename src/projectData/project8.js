        'During my minor at Embrace TEC, a program at Fontys Pulsed, I participated in a 20-week curriculum integrating technology, entrepreneurship, and creativity. This program deviates from traditional education by employing a challenge-based, student-centered approach using design thinking methodologies.'

        'One of the challenges was to create a "Shitty Robot." The goal was to design an interactive toy for 5 to 6-year-old students from Primary School De Driestam. The toy needed to be both entertaining and educational, constructed from sustainable materials.'

        'Our group of five, each from different study backgrounds, began by interviewing the teacher, talking to parents on campus, and conducting desk research. We found that kids today have very short attention spans, so we needed something captivating. They love themed characters, colorful objects, and fast-moving things. Using the round-robin brainstorming method, we developed "Dino Hoops." This remote-controlled educational tool features a T-Rex car with a basketball hoop, lights, and sounds. When kids score, they receive coins with words and matching images they\'re learning.',
        'Spelling the words correctly to the teacher earns them another turn, and collecting four words wins fun accessories like pirate hats and swords.'

        'We were required to use recyclable materials. I opted for 3D printing, laser cutting, Arduino electronics, and items from second-hand stores. Starting with a paper prototype, I used my 3D modeling skills to create a dino head and learned how to use a laser cutter to make a sturdy wooden box for the electronics. Due to time constraints, we used a toy car from a second-hand store, allowing me to focus on the ultrasonic sensors, lights, and speakers for the hoops. I also conducted a small workshop on soldering for my group members, and together we assembled and tested the car\'s durability, aesthetics, and functionality.'

      paragraphs: [
        'We playtested the toy with over 60 kids at the school. The kids loved it and were very enthusiastic, though a few hyperactive students caused some chaos. While the toy succeeded in entertaining and capturing their attention, the educational aspect was less effective. However, the car survived the playtest without breaking.'

      paragraphs: [
        'Overall, the project was very enjoyable. I enjoyed the process of learning new skills, leading the team, and teaching others. It was great to revisit my background in electronicsâ€”I used to be an electrician and studied electrical engineering for a year. Eventually, I switched to ICT, focusing more on coding, which brought a refreshing change and new challenges.'
