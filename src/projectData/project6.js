        'During my minor at Embrace TEC, a program at Fontys Pulsed, I engaged in a 20-week curriculum integrating technology, entrepreneurship, and creativity. This program uses a challenge-based, student-centered approach with design thinking methodologies, deviating from traditional education.'

        'The challenge from Novadic-Kentron, an organization specializing in addiction care and rehabilitation, was to prevent MDMA use at festivals and convince current users to reconsider. They provide medical, psychological, and social support for individuals struggling with substance abuse.'

      paragraphs: [
        'We began by interviewing experts provided by Novadic-Kentron, revealing diverse viewpoints on drug use. Some advocated for strict bans and harsh punishments, while others, including former heavy drug users, supported making drugs available with more research, education, and regulation for safe use. To gather public opinions, we spoke with people on the streets of Eindhoven, including those at stoner spots, homeless individuals, hospitality workers known to use substances like cocaine, and attendees of rave parties. We also conducted desk research. Using the ideation technique SCAMPER, we developed our idea for "MDMA Jenga," focusing on showcasing the randomness and potential dangers of MDMA effects so our approach is to educated and let them come up with their own conclusions instead forcing someone to make a decision.'

        'We created a paper prototype, pitched it to our experts, and iterated based on feedback. We laser-cut the Jenga pieces, which took some time, and tested the game multiple times to refine the rules.'

    {
      header: 'Outcome',
      paragraphs: [
        'The result is an educational game designed to raise awareness about the consequences of MDMA use. Using the familiar Jenga format, players interact with two stacks of blocks representing their health and emotional state before and after MDMA use. Dice rolls dictate block removal, introducing instability and symbolizing the drug\'s effects. Players must also draw from a black box containing deformed blocks, representing the unpredictable and often harmful symptoms of MDMA use. The game serves as a conversation starter to highlight the risks and unpredictable nature of MDMA use.'

      paragraphs: [
        'Discussing the topic was challenging due to the diverse opinions and the need to remain neutral, neither promoting nor condemning drug use. It was also important to find ways to encourage individuals to reconsider their habits without judgment. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of addiction and substance abuse and their impacts on individuals and those around them. I am proud of the solution we developed, which our client plans to use as an icebreaker in therapy sessions to help start conversations with patients.'
