The primary objective of the game is to teach children in grades 7 and 8 about the importance of probiotics and healthy living. Here are the key elements of the assignment:'

        'The game was quite static, lacking interaction, animation, sound, and vibrant colorsâ€”it was essentially a series of still images moving around. Although it was created in 2D, it was positioned to look like a 3D game. Making something both fun and educational for kids, who often have short attention spans, is particularly challenging.',
        'I had to learn animation techniques and study the "12 Principles of Animation" guide. I also learned how to add effects and structure components in Unity. The game\'s existing code had no comments or explanatory documentation, so we had to figure out how it worked on our own.'

        'For the animations, we made quick paper prototypes with stop-motion techniques, created a sandbox environment, and based our updates on research about color theory and other relevant topics. We then tested the updated game during the "Night of the Nerds" event with over 80 kids.'

        'Typically, the game is controlled by teachers who set the difficulty level. However, during playtesting, this approach didn\'t work well. Instead, we let the kids take control, making the experience more personal, competitive, and engaging. While figuring out the game and its rules, the kids unexpectedly learned and taught each other about gut health.'
